# another chrome weather extension

## about

**acwe** is a chrome extension that will override the default chrome "new tab" page into a minimalistic page features the essentialsâ€”a google search bar and handy weather information.

## weather data

the weather data is requested from the [national weather service's](https://www.weather.gov) public api which uses a system of gridpoints to issue forecasts. 

accordingly, the extension makes an initial request using the browser's location to determine the user's gridpoint, and sends subsequent requests using the gridpoint to fetch weather data.
